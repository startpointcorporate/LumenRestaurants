// Lumen Restaurants: the help for staff (LumenPOS 0.58.0, help/content.js) at a
// restaurant too. LumenPOS's screens, topics, tours and news come as LumenPOS
// writes them (help/content.js, merged as it is), and this file lays the
// restaurant's on top. The till reads the help from here (stores/help.js,
// HelpPanel.vue, HelpCard.vue):
//  - the help of the restaurant screens (the tables, the kitchen, bookings, the
//    booking page, the Menu page), and at a restaurant outlet the order
//    screen's help in place of the shop sell screen's;
//  - the "sell" tour walks the restaurant order screen at a restaurant outlet
//    (RestaurantSellView carries the same data-tour markers, and order-type and
//    kitchen-send of its own), the shop's steps stay for a shop outlet;
//  - what is new, on OUR release numbers (0.1.0-rN, where the N counts):
//    LumenPOS's news is dated by the release of ours that brought it, ours is
//    added, and a LumenPOS entry that says something else here is replaced.
// Every text is an English key for t(); the Arabic is in messages-restaurant.js.
