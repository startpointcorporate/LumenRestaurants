"""The public booking page, /book/<outlet>.

The link a restaurant puts on its social media, so it has to look like the
restaurant, not like us: every word, colour, font, background, question and
package on it comes from the outlet's POS Booking Page, designed in the till.
This file only hands that design to the page, which draws itself from it.

Guests see a page only while it is published. ?preview=1 shows the saved (or
the designer's live) design to a signed-in user who may read booking pages,
published or not, and a preview never submits anything.
