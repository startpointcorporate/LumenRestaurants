"""Lumen Restaurants: the floor plan of a restaurant outlet (0.1.0-r14).

The Tables screen draws each area of the outlet as a plan: its tables with
their chairs, in their shape and where they stand, and the walls, doors and
the rest around them (POS Floor Area). An outlet switches it off on its POS
Profile (`lr_floor_plan`) and keeps the list of tables only, as before. Who
may change the plan is its own permission, "Edit the floor plan"
(permissions.EDIT_FLOOR), closed until a restaurant names someone.

The screen's calls are in api/floor.py, the floor itself in
api/restaurant.get_floor.
