"""The little machine behind "order number 47".

One row per outlet per day. The number a takeaway customer is called by has to
be SHORT (nobody shouts an invoice name across a food court), START AT 1 EVERY
MORNING, and never repeat within the day even with two tills selling at once.
So the row is taken with a row lock inside the sale's own transaction: if the
sale fails, the number was never handed out.
